### .NET 8 MAUI Application (Windows only for now)
### Voice Controller 

Create voice commands to open applications (currently working on)


## Todo:
1. Better state management
2. Better solution to save custom commands to AppData
3. Make more tailored custom commands (not only opening applications)
4. Ability to have application running in the background
5. Summon voice capture for commands on shortcut
